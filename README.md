# Machine Learning API for Tshirt Size Determination
## Introduction
7.8 billion different people but just five conventional t-shirt sizes – XS, S, M, L, and XL. Hence, to provide a much better fit, we are creating three different t-shirt lengths (the Short, Regular, and Long) for each conventional t-shirt size – effectively providing you with fifteen different options. The following table clearly explains the sizes provided.
