# Machine Learning API for Tshirt Size Determination
## Introduction
7.8 billion different people but just five conventional t-shirt sizes – XS, S, M, L, and XL. Hence, to provide a much better fit, we are creating three different t-shirt lengths (the Short, Regular, and Long) for each conventional t-shirt size – effectively providing you with fifteen different options. To further ease this process, the following Neural Network powered API takes the user’s height, weight, shoe size, and preferred t-shirt fit (Standard or Relaxed) and provides the perfect t-shirt with its respective confidence percentage.

Please note that this API is currently in its development stage and is meant for men’s sizes. Future developments include reformatting the front end of the API and improving the model to provide accurate t-shirt sizes for men and women alike.
